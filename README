>>>Project Goals:
The goal of this project is to bring all sorts of UIC related information
to students with out the need to go on a mad scavenger hunt
|=======================|

>>>Design in Mind:
Front End:
We are going to go with a "tab and section" styled layout
-Homepage, a place to start
-Maps, any type of map graphic one would need around UIC 
including CTA and food
-Directory, listing of staff contact info
-Courses, listing of course selection
-Events/News, news feed
-Athletics, scores and updates on sport teams
-Library, information on library and contents
-Book Store, book pricing and look up
-Housing, useful housing information including laundry view
-Safety, numbers to call

Back End:
-Restaurant Database, a text file storing all restaurant information 
for a location
-Menu Database, text files per restaurant that contain menu, food and price
-Course Database, html files re made containing course data
-HTML Parser, finds the information we want from a website,
very custom build and not too flexible, but it works well
-Menu Loader, loads in and allows manipulation of menu info
-Location Loader, loads in and allows manipulation of restaurant info

>>>Implementation of Ideas:

I would grab all the menu pages as HTML and then extract the name and
price of each dish and store them in text files.
-Part two of my project was finding a way to put this data to use. I
